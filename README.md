# EK301 Final Project

**Introduction**

&emsp; We approached the selection for the design of our truss by focusing on the maximum load
that the truss could support as well as looking at the cost/load ratio. To achieve the maximum
load, we used our program to find the weakest member, the one that would buckle the first. Then,
we changed the coordinates of this member to shorten its length. By repeating this process
multiple times, we were able to achieve a relatively high max load. Then, we looked at the
cost/load ratio and made minor adjustments to the lengths to attempt to minimize this. We did not
completely disregard the uncertainty; we chose a design that when the failure weight was
calculated with Pcrit as 2570/(L^2) -8.9oz (or weaker buckling strength value), it was still
greater than the minimum 32 oz applied. Nonetheless, the design selection was based mainly on
maximizing the failure load.
